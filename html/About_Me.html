        Profile </h1>

    <p id="text">
My interest in IT started during my A levels in which I was studying ICT. Here I learnt the basics of computing and IT structures. This allowed me to form a good basic knowledge which I can constantly improve upon to keep up with the ever-changing nature of the industry. After studying at college I moved onto university in order to further my skills and enhance my understanding.

After leaving university, I started working for an IT business in which I offered technical support to clients and installed network communications. However, I wanted to pursue a career that allowed me to specialise in a certain area with the right training and progression. This is the reason I was eager to explore an opportunity with QA Consulting. Through this, I am aiming to further my professional career and achieve my personal goals.

        Hobbies/Interests </h1>
    <p id="text">

In my spare time, I like to keep fit. I go to the gym regularly and occasionally play 5 a side football. These activities benefit not only my physical health but they allow me to work effectively in a team. I also enjoy painting and being able to be creative; by this I mean from both an artistic and a DIY perspective. Another interest of mine is collecting vinyl records, as I have a keen interest in music from all time periods.
